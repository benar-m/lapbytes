# LapBytes Backend Requirements

LapBytes is a backend-first laptop e-commerce platform built in Go.  The goal is on building a functional real-world backend system with clean APIs, modular architecture, and concurrency in mind.

---

## Functional Requirements

- [ ] **User Registration and Login**  
  Users must be able to register on the platform and log in. The system will handle authentication and maintain user sessions using JWT to keep users logged in while they browse laptops.

- [ ] **Product Listing**  
  The site will list laptops that users can browse. Each laptop will have details like brand, model, CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, price, and a short description. The backend will retrieve this data from a database.

- [ ] **Search**  
  Users will be able to search for laptops based on different criteria such as brand, model, CPU, or price range.

- [ ] **Shopping Cart**  
  Users can add laptops to a virtual shopping cart, adjust quantities, or remove items from the cart.

- [ ] **Checkout**  
  The checkout feature will collect user shipping information and payment details.
- [ ] **Order Management**  
  After a purchase, the user’s order details (such as items, quantities, prices, and delivery status) will be recorded and retrievable by the user.

- [ ] **Administration**  
  There will be functionalities for site administrators to add, update, or remove laptop listings, view orders, and manage users.

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] The backend of the laptop store will be developed entirely in Go, sticking to  Go's standard library as much as possible and additional frameworks and libraries where appropriate.

- [ ] The frontend may be simple, as the focus is on backend development. Basic HTML and JavaScript will be used for demonstration purposes.

- [ ] A relational database will store user and product information. MySQL or PostgreSQL could be used depending on the requirements for complexity.

- [ ] The backend will handle concurrent users efficiently, using Go’s goroutines and channels to manage multiple users interacting with the website at the same time.

- [ ] Basic security measures will be implemented, including secure password storage, HTTPS for secure communications, and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

- [ ] RESTful APIs will be developed for handling frontend requests like adding items to the cart, checking out, and user registration.

- [ ] The application will be containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

## Design Considerations

- [ ] **Modular**  
  The backend will be structured in a modular fashion, separating concerns and making the system easier to manage and scale. For instance, authentication, product management, and order processing might each be a separate module.

- [ ] **State**  
  Given the need for session management in e-commerce platforms, careful consideration will be given to how user state is maintained across the user's journey on the site.

- [ ] **Performance**  
  Performance will be a key consideration, especially for database interactions and API response times. The design will include efficient querying and data handling strategies to ensure a smooth user experience.

- [ ] **Scalability**  
  The architecture will support scaling, particularly through the use of microservices where necessary.
